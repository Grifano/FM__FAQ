## My process !

### Built with !

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive images
- Responsive Website

### What I learned !

Using "picture" tag, browser know what image should to load depending on viewport width ðŸ˜€

```html
<picture>
	<source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="images/image-header-mobile.jpg">
	<source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="images/image-header-desktop.jpg">
	<img src="images/image-header-desktop.jpg" alt="people working in workspace">
</picture>
```
Thanks to this code, I was able to make the image responsive and look good on different screen size
```css
.card-preview__image img {
	max-width: 100%;
	min-height: 100%;
	object-fit: cover;
}
```
<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn a JavaScript. Currently, I'm working on Course from Udemy. App Brewery Web Developer Bootcamp. And to do practice, practice and practice one more ðŸ˜‰
